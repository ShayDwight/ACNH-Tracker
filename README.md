# ACNH-Tracker

Things I'm planning on adding: 
- ~~bugs, fossils, and art, obviously.~~
- ~~pictures of all~~
- a way to sort by location via buttons (like caught, not caught, donated), (example: river, pond, sea, tree stump, palm trees, etc)
- a way to download your current donated/caught list to be able to re-upload if something goes wrong, or an account system of some kind, probably based on google
- a way to show ~~only available fish/bugs~~, last chance fish/bugs, 
- a Last Updated clock
- a This Table is Based on This Time clock
- progress bars listing completion

- a Settings button that includes such things as:
  - a color-blind mode button to add/remove icons on the Availability column.
  - a 12/24 hour selector button
  - a way to select a different month/day if you TT
  - ~~S hemisphere fish months (and bugs) selector~~

# New Things Since Last Update!

- Separated out Critter Filters and Caught (Status) Filters into their own functions. As such, you can now only select **ONE** Critter Type and Status Type instead of being able to select multiple Types at the same time. It should make further updates easier, as well as being able to code in Location Filters (River, Pond, Tree Stump, etc). 

- Added **Show Available Now** button that *actually* works! It's not toggleable yet, but it works for both N and S Hemisphere! To reset it showing to ALL critters, Refresh the page!
- ~~Added Sea Creatures!~~
  
As always, if you don't see what's new, force a hard refresh by hitting Ctrl+F5 on your keyboard! 

# Things I need to fix: 

Toggleable Show Available Now button.
