# ACNH-Tracker

Things I'm planning on adding: 
- ~~bugs~~, fossils, and art, obviously. 
- pictures of all
- a way to sort by location via buttons (like caught, not caught, donated), (example: river, pond, sea, tree stump, palm trees, etc)
- a way to download your current donated/caught list to be able to re-upload if something goes wrong, or an account system of some kind, probably based on google
- a way to show only available fish/bugs, last chance fish/bugs, 
- a Last Updated clock
- a This Table is Based on This Time clock
- progress bars listing completion

- a Settings button that includes such things as:
  - a color-blind mode button to add/remove icons on the Availability column.
  - a 12/24 hour selector button
  - a way to select a different month/day if you TT
  - S hemisphere fish months (and bugs) selector
  
  
if you don't think you have the latest version (the hour/month squares do NOT have any blue now), force a hard refresh by first clicking Clear localStorage, then hitting Ctrl+F5 on your keyboard. 

# Things I need to fix: 

- I just noticed a slight bug. If you click Fish, then Show All, then Fish again, the button/outline for Fish (or any other Type) will disappear, and the table will be empty. Some variable I set is not clearing correctly.
- I need to fix the hours set for some of the later-in-the-list bugs. The time shown in the Availability columns is wrong.
