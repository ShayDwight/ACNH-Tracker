# ACNH-Tracker

Things I'm planning on adding: 
- ~~bugs, fossils, and art, obviously.~~
- ~~pictures of all~~
- a way to sort by location via buttons (like caught, not caught, donated), (example: river, pond, sea, tree stump, palm trees, etc)
- a way to download your current donated/caught list to be able to re-upload if something goes wrong, or an account system of some kind, probably based on google
- a way to show ~~only available fish/bugs~~, last chance fish/bugs, 
- a Last Updated clock
- a This Table is Based on This Time clock
- progress bars listing completion

- a Settings button that includes such things as:
  - a color-blind mode button to add/remove icons on the Availability column.
  - a 12/24 hour selector button
  - a way to select a different month/day if you TT
  - ~~S hemisphere fish months (and bugs) selector~~

# New Things Since Last Update!

- Added **Show Available Now** button that *actually* works! It's not toggleable yet, but it works for both N and S Hemisphere! To reset it showing to ALL critters, Refresh the page!
- ~~Added Sea Creatures!~~
  
As always, if you don't see what's new, force a clean refresh by first clicking Clear localStorage, and then forcing a refresh by hitting Ctrl+F5 on your keyboard! 

# Things I need to fix: 

Nothing at the moment, besides adding what's listed above!
