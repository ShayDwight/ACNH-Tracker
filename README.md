# ACNH-Tracker

Things I'm planning on adding: 
- ~~bugs, fossils, and art, obviously.~~
- ~~pictures of all~~
- ~~a way to sort by location via buttons (like caught, not caught, donated), (example: river, pond, sea, tree stump, palm trees, etc)~~
- a way to download your current donated/caught list to be able to re-upload if something goes wrong, or an account system of some kind, probably based on google
- a way to show ~~only available fish/bugs~~, last chance fish/bugs, 
- a Last Updated clock
- a This Table is Based on This Time clock
- progress bars listing completion

- a Settings button that includes such things as:
  - a color-blind mode button to add/remove icons on the Availability column.
  - a 12/24 hour selector button
  - a way to select a different month/day if you TT
  - ~~S hemisphere fish months (and bugs) selector~~

# New Things Since Last Update!

- Added **LOCATION FILTERS**!! Each Critter Type (Fish, Bugs, Sea) now has a drop-down arrow next to their respective buttons where you can select the specific location of each of the critters! You will need to use the **Reset Table Data** button (explained below) to fix the table so that all of the Critters will display properly when you use a Location Filter.

- Added **Warning** to please disable tracker-blockers or ad-blockers. I added Google Analytics so that I could see who is currently using my page! (Trust me, I cannot see **ANY** of your personal information. I can *only* see *if* someone is currently using my ACNH Tracker, or how many people have used it. It's a new-school page counter. Remember those?) 

- *Changed* **Clear localStorage** button to **Reset Table Data** button! This button is useful for resetting the table data in case you encounter errors. The only drawback is it **WILL DELETE YOUR PROGRESS**. The next update should include a way to download what Critters you've caught or donated so that we don't have to destroy your save every time I update the raw file used to generate the table. The Raw file should not have to be updated again, unless some major re-classification happens in game, or a whole new slew of Critters are added/changed. 

- ~~Separated out Critter Filters and Caught (Status) Filters into their own functions. As such, you can now only select **ONE** Critter Type and Status Type instead of being able to select multiple Types at the same time. It should make further updates easier, as well as being able to code in Location Filters (River, Pond, Tree Stump, etc). ~~

- ~~Added **Show Available Now** button that *actually* works! It's not toggleable yet, but it works for both N and S Hemisphere! To reset it showing to ALL critters, Refresh the page!~~
- ~~Added Sea Creatures!~~
  
As always, if you don't see what's new, force a hard refresh by hitting Ctrl+F5 on your keyboard! 

# Things I need to fix: 

Toggleable Show Available Now button.
